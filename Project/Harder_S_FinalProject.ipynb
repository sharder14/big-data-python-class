    "For my final project in Big Data Analysis using Python, I choose to perform and analysis on the 2016 US election. The goal of this project was to gain experience using machine learning libraries as well as data visualization packages. \n",

    "\n",
    "I will be trying to predict county level outcome in Pennsylvania from the 2016 election. The attributes that I am using to make the prediction are various metrics such as demographics, economic and societal factors. I will use a variety of algorithms from Support Vector Machines to Convloutional Neural Networks through scikit learn to make the predictions. After the predictions are made, I will display the maps using Plotly. "

    "The data from Kaggle contained 4 different tables, however I only needed to use two of them. The first one being the voting results table, the second one being the county facts table. To preprocess the data, I needed to clean certain things up. For instance, Alaska was not uniform throughout the tables, so I removed it all together. \n",

    "Our algorithms were able to predict the county level results of PA with up to 92% accuracy. This was due to the feature selection method used, recursive feature elimination. We were able to see that logistic regression and knn tied as the most accurate algorithms. Lastly we were able to see that we could predict the tri-state county level results with almost 80% accuracy. It is worth noting that these models are only useful for predicting the 2016 results. Such models are not reliable enough to predict the future county level results without further analysis of additional data.\n",
